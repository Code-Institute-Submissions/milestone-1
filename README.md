# Technologies Used

#### Photoshop - _Image editing_

* Being an expieranced Photoshop user I used the sofware to reduce the file size of all the images with the purpose of optimization to reduce loading times of the website, especially on mobile devices.  
The original images sizes where between 4000 and 5000 pixels and approximately 3-5mb each on disk. I reduced the images to 1400 pixels, anything below that size was causing noticeable aliasing. This reduction in size got each of the images to under 1mb size on disk.

* I also used Photoshop to convert the DJ profile images to black and white and in the hue and saturation colour settings I got each image to the same level of brightness, I then added a colour tint of a darkish brown to make the images have a more warm and welcoming feel to them.

* **Dot Overlay Image**

   - For the dot overlay image on the landing page I created a 6x6 pixel background in Photoshop. I then used the brush tool with a white colour to make the dot but only have 1 of the pixels solid and surounding pixels fade out. I then used a gray layer and set the image to 50% opacity.   
   In the CSS I also used a gray colour that is part of the colour scheme of the website by useing the RGBA(24,24,24,0.8) and played around with the colour and transparency untill I thought it felt right.
   
   - The reason I used the dot overlay is because the background image of the crowd had some inperfections and the image was to bright making the landing page text looked to washed out, by using the dot ovlerlay it made the text stand out more. The dot overlay also makes for a nice decoration and feature to the landing page.

#### TinyPNG - _Image compression_

* The online image compression tool TinyPNG/JPG was used for further optimization of the images to improve loading times of the website. After the compression the images had been reduced by up to 70% leaving the filesize on disk for each image roughtly between 80-300 kb.

#### Balsamiq - _Wireframes_

* I used the free cloud trail of Balsamiq wireframing software to create the wireframes for the project.

#### HTML5 - _Hypertext Markup Language_

* HTML5 is the standard markup language and was used to create the basic structure of the website, semantic elements where used to provide meaning of the content to search engines.

#### CSS3 - _Cascading Style Sheets_

* CSS3 was used to decorate the HTML and style the page layout with colours, Fonts, positioning of content, and to make the site responsive on all devices.   
I also used custom CSS3 to override bootstraps default stylings.

   https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/
   
#### Javascript - _Programming Language_

* Although not required for this project, some JavaScript was used and added to the end of the HTML document. Some scripts such as smooth scrolling with navagation and also the spinning icon was used as a visual indicator when scrolling the page. The reason these scripts where added was for a better user expierance on giving a nice smooth flow to the navigation of the page.

#### Cloud 9 - _Intergrated Development Enviorment_

* The cloud9 (IDE) was used for the development of this project.

#### Bootstrap V4.1.3 - _Front End CSS/JS Framework_

* Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, Mobile first sites. This was used to speed up development, by using bootstraps library of design templates such as The navagation bar, The grid system, Modal, Buttons, Tables, and Forms.
   
  - **Bootstrap V4.1.3 -** https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/

  I used custom CSS heavily to override bootstrap default stylings.

* **Content Delivery Network**

   - I used the Bootstrap(CDN) system of delivery method for this project. I added the Bootstrap CSS link to the head of the HTML and at the bottom I then added three JavaScript plugins that are required for some of the bootstrap components to work.   
   Bootstrap uses its own JavaScript plugin along with JQuery and Popper.js
   
  - **jQuery's Slim Build -** https://blog.jquery.com/2016/06/09/jquery-3-0-final-released/
  - **Popper.js -** https://popper.js.org/


#### Git - _Version Control System_

* Although Git can be downloaded seperatly, The git I used for this project came prebundled package that was part of the Cloud9 (IDE) I used Git to commit versions of the project to repositories on Github.
 
  https://git-scm.com/
  

#### GitHub - _Hosting Version Control Repositories_

* GitHub was used as an external backup, version control and hosting of the projects repositories. Github pages was also used for hosting and deployment of the website.

   https://github.com/
   
#### Font Awesome - _Icons_

* For this project I used icons from Font Awesome, and used the free CDN as a delivery method.

  https://fontawesome.com/
  
#### Google Fonts - _Typography_   

* The font families that are used on the website where imported from Google Fonts extensive library. The font 'Ubuntu' was used for the logo text and the font 'Roboto' was used as the main text throughout the site.

   https://fonts.google.com/
   
#### Favicon - _Tab Icon_

* I used Font Awsome Favicon Generator tool, to create a favicon from a selection of font awesome icons.

  https://gauger.io/fonticon/
  
#### Hover.css - _Hover Effects_

* Hover.css was used to add a hover underline border transition to the navigation menu bar and also to the get in touch section of the page using a hover bob effect on the Address, Phone , and email infor section.

#### W3C Validation

* _**Markup Validation Service**_

  This online service was used to check the validation of the HTML code.
  * _**Errors encountered and fixed**_
   
    * **Images:** I removed stray end tags on images that where displaying errors in validation results. The removed end tags fixed the issue.
    
    * **Music Player Embeds:** The music player embeds where displaying errors in the valadition results. The 100% width was giving a error bad value so I removed it and added it to the CSS instead.  
      Removed Frameborder from the music player embeds as it is an obsolete element and I used Border in the CSS instead.   
    I removed Scrolling element from music player embeds.

      Putting the HTML through the validitation again displays no Errors or Warnings.
