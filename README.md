# Technologies Used
fevacon

#### Photoshop - _Image editing_

* Being an expieranced Photoshop user I used the sofware to reduce the file size of all the images with the purpose of optimization to reduce loading times of the website, especially on mobile devices.  
The original images sizes where between 4000 and 5000 pixels and approximately 3-5mb each on disk. I reduced the images to 1400 pixels, anything below that size was causing noticeable aliasing. This reduction in size got each of the images to under 1mb size on disk.

* I also used Photoshop to convert the DJ profile images to black and white and in the hue and saturation colour settings I got each image to the same level of brightness, I then added a colour tint of a darkish brown to make the images have a more warm and welcoming feel to them.

* **Dot Overlay Image**

   - For the dot overlay image on the landing page I created a 6x6 pixel background in Photoshop. I then used the brush tool with a white colour to make the dot but only have 1 of the pixels solid and surounding pixels fade out. I then used a gray layer and set the image to 50% opacity.   
   In the CSS I also used a gray colour that is part of the colour scheme of the website by useing the RGBA(24,24,24,0.8) and played around with the colour and transparency untill I thought it felt right.
   
   - The reason I used the dot overlay is because the background image of the crowd had some inperfections and the image was to bright making the landing page text looked to washed out, by using the dot ovlerlay it made the text stand out more. The dot overlay also makes for a nice decoration and feature to the landing page.

#### TinyPNG - _Image compression_

* The online image compression tool TinyPNG/JPG was used for further optimization of the images to improve loading times of the website. After the compression the images had been reduced by up to 70% leaving the filesize on disk for each image roughtly between 80-300 kb.

I also used custom CSS3 to override bootstraps default stylings.

#### Javascript - _Programming Language_

* Although not required for this project, some JavaScript was used and added to the end of the HTML document. Some scripts such as smooth scrolling with navagation and also the spinning icon was used as a visual indicator when scrolling the page. The reason these scripts where added was for a better user expierance on giving a nice smooth flow to the navigation of the page.

  - **Bootstrap V4.1.3 -** https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/

  I used custom CSS heavily to override bootstrap default stylings.

* **Content Delivery Network**

   - I used the Bootstrap(CDN) system of delivery method for this project. I added the Bootstrap CSS link to the head of the HTML and at the bottom I then added three JavaScript plugins that are required for some of the bootstrap components to work.   
   Bootstrap uses its own JavaScript plugin along with JQuery and Popper.js
