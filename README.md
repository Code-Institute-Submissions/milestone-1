# UX

This website is for DJs, venue owners and fans of Deep house music to book and hire DJs for their venue, listen to new DJ mixes and Track releases. Users of the website can also look at the latest upcoming events to find out where their favourite DJs are playing.   

The website is a mobile first design, and so I decided to go with the one page layout rather than multiple pages. The reason being is that I believe the one page layout would be more efficient and easier to navigate on mobile devices.

The main objective of this website is to get as many subscribers and followers of Deephouse, in creating awareness and growth for the brand, and in doing so getting more clients, with the goal at becoming one of the top go to DJ hire and fan resource page for the Deephouse dance music genre.   

At the beginning during the strategy faze I spent a lot of time researching other DJ hire and electronic dance music websites for inspiration, and to try to build up an idea in my head of what I wanted my website to look like. I also looked at what I needed to do, to make my site unique and stand out from the rest.   
From what I gathered on my research is that many of these sites only focused on one particular feature, such as DJ hire sites with booking a DJ only, Music sites was only listening to the tracks, Music videos on YouTube, and the event listings are all on separate websites. So from that, what I decided to do was to combine all these features into the one website.   

I then created a list on a piece of paper of what was worth doing and the importance and viability of all the features listed, and by doing so I managed to cut out a lot unnecessary features that would have otherwise cluttered up the website.

At this stage I knew exactly what I wanted to do and I was visualizing the website and how it was going to look in my head. I then used the free trail of Balsamiq to layout the wireframes for this project.

From the start I knew I wanted a dark colour theme, as I wanted to signify the mood of a dark nightclub. From my research I came across several colour theory and phycology websites and how colours can affect userâ€™s moods, and from what I learnt is that blackish colours represents power, luxury, sophistication and elegance that evoke professionalism. The greyish colours represents neutral, simplicity, calm, futuristic and logic and is associated with technology and sophistication. This is exactly the mood I wanted to reflect from the website.   

![Colour scheme](https://github.com/thepixel8or/milestone-1/raw/master/assets/images/Colour-Scheme.jpg "Colour Scheme")

Along with the shades of black and grey, I had decided to use red, blue and green colours to represent the lights that you would see in a nightclub for use on icons and logos, this worked well, but later changed the shades of the red, blue and green colours to match that of the Music player embeds that I sourced from Beatport. The reason being is that I could not change the CSS for the player embeds and so I decided to match the colours to keep the site all the same colour theme.

# Technologies Used

#### Photoshop - _Image editing_

* Being an expieranced Photoshop user I used the sofware to reduce the file size of all the images with the purpose of optimization to reduce loading times of the website, especially on mobile devices.  
The original images sizes where between 4000 and 5000 pixels and approximately 3-5mb each on disk. I reduced the images to 1400 pixels, anything below that size was causing noticeable aliasing. This reduction in size got each of the images to under 1mb size on disk.

* I also used Photoshop to convert the DJ profile images to black and white and in the hue and saturation colour settings I got each image to the same level of brightness, I then added a colour tint of a darkish brown to make the images have a more warm and welcoming feel to them.

* **Dot Overlay Image**

   - For the dot overlay image on the landing page I created a 6x6 pixel background in Photoshop. I then used the brush tool with a white colour to make the dot but only have 1 of the pixels solid and surounding pixels fade out. I then used a gray layer and set the image to 50% opacity.   
   In the CSS I also used a gray colour that is part of the colour scheme of the website by useing the RGBA(24,24,24,0.8) and played around with the colour and transparency untill I thought it felt right.
   
   - The reason I used the dot overlay is because the background image of the crowd had some inperfections and the image was to bright making the landing page text looked to washed out, by using the dot ovlerlay it made the text stand out more. The dot overlay also makes for a nice decoration and feature to the landing page.

#### TinyPNG - _Image compression_

* The online image compression tool TinyPNG/JPG was used for further optimization of the images to improve loading times of the website. After the compression the images had been reduced by up to 70% leaving the filesize on disk for each image roughtly between 80-300 kb.

   https://tinypng.com/


#### Balsamiq - _Wireframes_

* I used the free cloud trail of Balsamiq wireframing software to create the wireframes for the project.

  https://balsamiq.com/

#### HTML5 - _Hypertext Markup Language_

* HTML5 is the standard markup language and was used to create the basic structure of the website, semantic elements where used to provide meaning of the content to search engines.

  https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/

#### CSS3 - _Cascading Style Sheets_

* CSS3 was used to decorate the HTML and style the page layout with colours, Fonts, positioning of content, and to make the site responsive on all devices.   
I also used custom CSS3 to override bootstraps default stylings.

   https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/
   
#### Javascript - _Programming Language_

* Although not required for this project, some JavaScript was used and added to the end of the HTML document. Some scripts such as smooth scrolling with navagation and also the spinning icon was used as a visual indicator when scrolling the page. The reason these scripts where added was for a better user expierance on giving a nice smooth flow to the navigation of the page.   

  https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript
  
#### Cloud 9 - _Intergrated Development Enviorment_

* The cloud9 (IDE) was used for the development of this project.

   https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/
   
#### Bootstrap V4.1.3 - _Front End CSS/JS Framework_

* Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, Mobile first sites. This was used to speed up development, by using bootstraps library of design templates such as The navagation bar, The grid system, Modal, Buttons, Tables, and Forms.
   
  - **Bootstrap V4.1.3 -** https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/

  I used custom CSS heavily to override bootstrap default stylings.

* **Content Delivery Network**

   - I used the Bootstrap(CDN) system of delivery method for this project. I added the Bootstrap CSS link to the head of the HTML and at the bottom I then added three JavaScript plugins that are required for some of the bootstrap components to work.   
   Bootstrap uses its own JavaScript plugin along with JQuery and Popper.js
   
  - **jQuery's Slim Build -** https://blog.jquery.com/2016/06/09/jquery-3-0-final-released/
  - **Popper.js -** https://popper.js.org/


#### Git - _Version Control System_

* Although Git can be downloaded seperatly, The git I used for this project came prebundled package that was part of the Cloud9 (IDE) I used Git to commit versions of the project to repositories on Github.
 
  https://git-scm.com/
  

#### GitHub - _Hosting Version Control Repositories_

* GitHub was used as an external backup, version control and hosting of the projects repositories. Github pages was also used for hosting and deployment of the website.

   https://github.com/
   
#### Font Awesome - _Icons_

* For this project I used icons from Font Awesome, and used the free CDN as a delivery method.

  https://fontawesome.com/
  
#### Google Fonts - _Typography_   

* The font families that are used on the website where imported from Google Fonts extensive library. The font 'Ubuntu' was used for the logo text and the font 'Roboto' was used as the main text throughout the site.

   https://fonts.google.com/
   
#### Favicon - _Tab Icon_

* I used Font Awsome Favicon Generator tool, to create a favicon from a selection of font awesome icons.

  https://gauger.io/fonticon/
  
#### Hover.css - _Hover Effects_

* Hover.css was used to add a hover underline border transition to the navigation menu bar and also to the get in touch section of the page using a hover bob effect on the Address, Phone , and email infor section.

#### Other Brousers

* **Firefox**   
  - The Firefox brouser and all its device emulators where tested along with window responsiveness and landscape and portrait displays.    
  No issues encountered and all work as intended.

* **Opera**
   - The Opera brouser and all its device emulators where tested along with window responsiveness and landscape and portraint displays.    
   No issues encountered and all work as intended.

* **Safari**
 
  * As I had no access to any Apple devices for testing, I downloaded Safari for windows on an windows 7 operating system.
  
  _**Issues Encountered**_ 

    * The latest verison of Safari I could get for windows was Safari 5.1.7. and on further research into this I found out that Apple has abandoned and discontinued development for Safari for windows many years ago, with the lastest update for this in 2012.   
  
      I treid to use this older version anyway but when I try view Github or the project I get a message that Safari cant establish connection to server github.com.    
      
      For this reason I could not conduct any testing for the Safari brouser. If in the future I can get access to an Appple device I will do testing for this.

* **Edge**
  
   * The Edge brouser and all its device emulators where tested along with window responsiveness and landscape and portrait displays.    

  _**Issue Encountered**_
  
  When testing on the Edge brouser I encounterd an issue with the image on the landing page. When the user scrolls the page the background image judders (_some sort of shaking_).   
  I have spent a lot of time on this project trying to resolve this one issue and have searched the internet tirelessly for a solution with no luck.    
  
  In my efforts to try pinpoint this problem I started to comment out all the javascript scripts and testing the site each time I removed a section of code. I continued to remove sections of code back to the bare minimum and also using Chrome dev tools untill I found what was causing the Issue.   
  From what I found is that the dot overlay image with transparancy that is overlayed on top of the background image on the landing page is causing this judder, and by removing this the site works fine. 
  
  Although I found what was causing the problem, and because it renders and displays perfect on all the other brousers I still had the issue of trying to find a fix for it on Edge.   
  If I was to leave out the dot overlay image just for the sake of Edge brouser the elegant look and feel of the site would be lost with the background image looking to bright and plain and the text looking washed out and hard to read.    
  So I continue to try find a solution for this problem    
  
  On my seach to try find a fix for the issue I came across numerious sites and forums with many offering some sort of solution and lots of comments saying that it was a common Microsoft bug with several posts offering Javascript hacks and solutions. All of the possible fixes I came across I treid and they did not resolve the issue.
  
  I also tried the Code Institute slack comunity for some feedback and possible fixes, but all solutions put forward I tried and did not fix the issue.    
  
  My conclusion on this issue is that I decided to leave the Dot Overlay image in the site as it works perfectly fine on the other brousers, with the pupose as i move forward onto the next module JavaScript Fundamentals that I can learn and better understand a way to fix this problem.
  
  
* **Internet Explorer**

  * Github and Github pages where I have this project deployed does not support Internet Explorer anymore with the message to use Edge, Chrome or firefox instead.   
  Regardless of this I had a look at the site anyway and there is an issue with the arrow down indicator pushing to the right and off the screen.   
  With futher research on the internet I discovered that Internet Explorer is outdated and obsolete brouser even with the latest IE11 still being updated by Microsoft but not supporting many of the modern technologies for a modern brouser expierance and to use Edge instead.

    For these reasons above I cannot conduct propper testing with Internet Explorer on this site as the results would be inconclusive.
