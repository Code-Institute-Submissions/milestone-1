# UX

This website is for DJs, venue owners and fans of Deep house music to book and hire DJs for their venue, as well as listen to new DJ mixes and Track releases. Users of the website can also look at the latest upcoming events to find out where their favourite DJs are playing.   

The website is a mobile first design, and so I decided to go with the one page layout rather than multiple pages. The reason being is that I believe the one page layout would be more efficient and easier to navigate on mobile devices.

The main objective of this website is to get as many subscribers and followers of Deephouse, in creating awareness and growth for the brand, and in doing so getting more clients, with the goal at becoming one of the top go to DJ hire and fan resource page for the Deephouse dance music genre.   

At the beginning during the strategy faze I spent a lot of time researching other DJ hire and electronic dance music websites for inspiration, and to try to build up an idea in my head of what I wanted my website to look like. I also looked at what I needed to do, to make my site unique and stand out from the rest.   
From what I gathered on my research is that many of these sites only focused on one particular feature, such as DJ hire sites with booking a DJ only, Music sites was only listening to the tracks, Music videos on YouTube, and the event listings are all on separate websites. So from that, what I decided to do was to combine all these features into the one website.   

I then created a list on a piece of paper of what was worth doing and the importance and viability of all the features listed, and by doing so I managed to cut out a lot unnecessary features that would have otherwise cluttered up the website.

At this stage I knew exactly what I wanted to do and I was visualizing the website and how it was going to look in my head. I then used the free trail of Balsamiq to layout the wireframes for this project.

From the start I knew I wanted a dark colour theme, as I wanted to signify the mood of a dark nightclub. From my research I came across several colour theory and phycology websites and how colours can affect user’s moods, and from what I learnt is that blackish colours represents power, luxury, sophistication and elegance that evoke professionalism. The greyish colours represents neutral, simplicity, calm, futuristic and logic and is associated with technology and sophistication. This is exactly the mood I wanted to reflect from the website.   

![Colour scheme](https://github.com/thepixel8or/milestone-1/raw/master/assets/images/Colour-Scheme.jpg "Colour Scheme")

Along with the shades of black and grey, I had decided to use red, blue and green colours to represent the lights that you would see in a nightclub for use on icons and logos, this worked well, but later changed the shades of the red, blue and green colours to match that of the Music player embeds that I sourced from Beatport. The reason being is that I could not change the CSS for the player embeds and so I decided to match the colours to keep the site all the same colour theme.   

* **Colour Picker:** _I used the colour picker from W3Schools to get colour variations for highlighting the buttons colour on hover and selecting._

# Features

#### Existing Features
* **Feature 1 - _The Navagation bar_**
  - The Navbar has a slight dark transparency and is fixed to the top and will follow the user as they scroll the page. I went with a fixed navbar as I wanted the user to be able to click any section on the Navbar menu and get their destination instantly without having to scroll back to the top.

  - When you hover over the menu links it highlights the text in white and displays a green underline effect that is visually pleasing to the user.
  
 
* **Features 2 - _Images_**
  
  - All images on the website where free and sourced from royalty free stock photo websites. The images where then edited and resized in Photoshop and a free online tool was used for compression to reduce file size.

* **Features 3 - _Subscribe Button_**
 
  - By clicking on the Subscribe button on the landing page the user gets a pop up modal where the user can input their email address and by clicking send will receive a monthly newsletter with all the latest information. This is intended for building up a lot of subscribers and fan base. (There is no back end server to this website and it’s just for educational purposes.)
  
* **Features 4 - _Book Now Button_**

   - The **Book Now** Button is to the right and is part of the Navbar, as with the Navbar the Book Now button will always be in view to the user as they scroll the page, when clicked it will bring you to the booking form destination where the user can fill in  a form to book a DJ for their club.
   
* **Features 5 - _Rotating Icon_**
 
   - The Deep house logo in the Navbar and centre of the landing page have an Icon that spins as you scroll the page, this is used just for user experience. Also the back to top Icon has the same rotation.

* **Features 6 - _Back to top indicator Icons_**

   - When you scroll past the landing page a Scroll to top indicator will appear, giving the user an indication that when clicked will bring the user back to the top of the landing page. The back to top icon is a CD with and arrow on top and the CD spins as you scroll the page. Clicking on the logo and on the home section of the Navbar will also bring the user back to the landing page.

* **Features 7 - _Bouncing arrow down_**

   - The bouncing animated arrow on the landing page it there as an indication to the user that they can scroll down the page for more information.   
   I got the idea to do this from what I learned by completing the bouncing ball challenge with Code Institute, by adding my own tweaks and an arrow icon to get the effect as a scroll down indicator.

* **Features 8 - _Sliding Profile information on DJ Images_**

   - As the user points their mouse over the DJ images in the About section, you get a horizontal slide transition that shows the user a little profile information on the DJ such as Name, age, Location and style of Music that they play.

* **Features 9 - _Club Scene Image Zoom_**

   - On the media section of the page when you move your mouse over the club scene images, the images will have a slight zoom effect.

* **Features 10 - _YouTube Videos_**

   - YouTube videos where embedded to show users what kind of music sets our DJs play at gigs, and what to expect at one of our shows.

* **Features 11 - _New Track Releases_**

   - The new tracks are there so that DJs can find out the latest top 5 deep house music releases and listen to it, with the option to buy from an external source.

* **Features 12 - _New DJ mixes_**

   - The new DJ mixes player embeds allows users to click on play and listen to DJ mixes

* **Features 13 - _Upcoming Events_**

   - The upcoming events section uses tables to create the listings and on smaller devices such as mobile phones the user is presented with a direction arrow left and right to indicate that you can scroll horizontally left and right to see more of the events listing.

* **Features 14 - _Booking Form_**

   - The booking form section allows users to enter their First and second name, email and phone number which are required fields the user can also select a country and DJ from a dropdown list and enter a message but these fields are optional. By clicking the send now button the booking form information will be sent. (_There is no backend server set up for this project, and this is just used for educational  purposes._)

* **Features 15 - _Get in Touch_**

   - The get in touch section provides contact information to the user such as Address, Phone number and Email address. When the user mousses over the contact information there is a bobbing up effect.

* **Features 16 - _Social Media Icon Links_**

   - The social media icons provide the users with links to Deep house social media platforms so the user can follow.

# Features Left to Implement

* **CSS limitations:** _To use JavaScript to edit default browser styles._
  
  * Some of the features that need to be implemented are on the Bootstrap booking form and modal sections, and I had reached the limitations of what I could do with custom CSS. I had to turn off auto complete on the email input sections, as there was no way to change the default browser style with custom CSS, and it was causing a white background to appear in the input section once a selection had been made.   
  
    The border colour of the dropdown menu for select country and DJ sections also could not be changed with custom CSS and believe it was a browser issue and would need JavaScript to fix this. Different browsers displaying default arrow style indicators on the enter phone number section would need to be removed or styled using JavaScript.

* **Other Feature Ideas:** _Some ideas of possible features in the future_.
  
  *  A forum for Deep House music fans to chat and share their views and ideas with other fans.

  *  Be able to book and purchase tickets for upcoming events. 
  
  *  The ability to purchase tracks on the website internally, rather than being directed to an external website.
  
  * To have DJ mixes available for download to users on the website.
    

# Technologies Used

#### Photoshop - _Image editing_

* Being an experienced Photoshop user I used the software to reduce the file size of all the images with the purpose of optimization to reduce loading times of the website, especially on mobile devices.  
The original images sizes where between 4000 and 5000 pixels and approximately 3-5mb each on disk. I reduced the images to 1400 pixels, and anything below that size was causing noticeable aliasing. This reduction in size got each of the images to less than 1mb size on disk.

* I also used Photoshop to convert the DJ profile images to black and white and in the hue and saturation colour settings I got each image to the same level of brightness, I then added a colour tint of a darkish brown to make the images have a more warm and welcoming feel to them.

* **Dot Overlay Image**

   - For the dot overlay image on the landing page I created a 6x6 pixel background in Photoshop. I then used the brush tool with a white colour to make the dot but only have 1 of the pixels solid and surrounding pixels fade out. I then used a grey layer and set the image to 50% opacity.   
   In the CSS I also used a grey colour that is part of the colour scheme of the website by using the RGBA(24,24,24,0.8) and played around with the colour and transparency until I thought it felt right.
   
   - The reason I used the dot overlay is because the background image of the crowd had some imperfections and the image was to bright making the landing page text looked too washed out, by using the dot overlay it made the text stand out more. The dots overlay also makes for a nice decoration and feature to the landing page.

#### TinyPNG - _Image compression_

* The online image compression tool TinyPNG/JPG was used for further optimization of the images to improve loading times of the website. After the compression the images had been reduced by up to 70% leaving the file size on disk for each image roughly between 80-300 kb.

   https://tinypng.com/


#### Balsamiq - _Wireframes_

* I used the free cloud trail of Balsamiq wire framing software to create the wireframes for the project.

  https://balsamiq.com/

#### HTML5 - _Hypertext Markup Language_

* HTML5 is the standard markup language and was used to create the basic structure of the website, semantic elements where used to provide meaning of the content to search engines.

  https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/

#### CSS3 - _Cascading Style Sheets_

* CSS3 was used to decorate the HTML and style the page layout with colours, Fonts, positioning of content, and to make the site responsive on all devices.   
I also used custom CSS3 to override bootstraps default stylings.

   https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/
   
#### Javascript - _Programming Language_

* Although not required for this project, some JavaScript was used and added to the end of the HTML document. Some scripts such as smooth scrolling with navigation and also the spinning icon was used as a visual indicator when scrolling the page. The reason these scripts where added was for a better user experience on giving a nice smooth flow to the navigation of the page.   

  https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript
  
#### Cloud 9 - _Intergrated Development Enviorment_

* The cloud9 (IDE) was used for the development of this project.

   https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/
   
#### Bootstrap V4.1.3 - _Front End CSS/JS Framework_

* Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, Mobile first sites. This was used to speed up development, by using bootstraps library of design templates such as the navigation bar, the grid system, Modal, Buttons, Tables, and Forms.
   
  - **Bootstrap V4.1.3 -** https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/

  I used custom CSS heavily to override bootstrap default stylings.

* **Content Delivery Network**

   - I used the Bootstrap (CDN) system of delivery method for this project. I added the Bootstrap CSS link to the head of the HTML and at the bottom I then added three JavaScript plugins that are required for some of the bootstrap components to work.   
   Bootstrap uses its own JavaScript plugin along with JQuery and Popper.js
   
  - **jQuery's Slim Build -** https://blog.jquery.com/2016/06/09/jquery-3-0-final-released/
  - **Popper.js -** https://popper.js.org/


#### Git - _Version Control System_

* Although Git can be downloaded separately, the Git I used for this project came as a pre bundled package that was part of the Cloud9 (IDE) I used Git to commit versions of the project to repositories on GitHub.
 
  https://git-scm.com/
  

#### GitHub - _Hosting Version Control Repositories_

* GitHub was used as an external backup, version control and hosting of the projects repositories. GitHub pages were also used for hosting and deployment of the website.

   https://github.com/
   
#### Font Awesome - _Icons_

* For this project I used icons from Font Awesome, and used the free CDN as a delivery method.

  https://fontawesome.com/
  
#### Google Fonts - _Typography_   

* The font families that are used on the website where imported from Google Fonts extensive library. The font 'Ubuntu' was used for the logo text and the font 'Roboto' were used as the main text throughout the site.

   https://fonts.google.com/
   
#### Favicon - _Tab Icon_

* I used Font Awesome Favicon Generator tool, to create a favicon from a selection of font awesome icons.

  https://gauger.io/fonticon/
  
#### Hover.css - _Hover Effects_

* Hover.css was used to add a hover underline border transition to the navigation menu bar and also to the get in touch section of the page using a hover bob effect on the Address, Phone, and email info section.

**Questionable Issue:** _When testing on Chrome device emulators, I noticed that when scrolling over YouTube videos and music players on mobile devices seems to lose its focus. When I tested this on a real mobile device, this does not happen and scrolling works fine. So I’m not really sure if the emulators are 100% accurate._  

#### Other Brousers

* **Firefox**   
  - The Firefox browser and all its device emulators where tested along with window responsiveness and landscape and portrait displays.    
  No issues encountered and all work as intended.

* **Opera**
   - The Opera browser and all its device emulators where tested along with window responsiveness and landscape and portrait displays.    
   No issues encountered and all work as intended.

* **Safari**
 
  * As I had no access to any Apple devices for testing, I downloaded Safari for Windows on a Windows 7 operating system.
  
  _**Issues Encountered**_ 

    * The latest version of Safari I could get for windows was Safari 5.1.7. And on further research into this I found out that Apple has abandoned and discontinued development for Safari for windows many years ago, with the latest update for this in 2012.   
  
      I tried to use this older version anyway but when I try view GitHub or the project I get a message that Safari can't establish connection to server github.com.    
      
      For this reason I could not conduct any testing for the Safari browser. If in the future I can get access to an Apple device I will do testing for this.

* **Edge**
  
   * The Edge browser and all its device emulators where tested along with window responsiveness and landscape and portrait displays.    

  _**Issue Encountered**_
  
  When testing on the Edge browser I encountered an issue with the image on the landing page. When the user scrolls the page the background image judders (_some sort of shaking_).   
  I have spent a lot of time on this project trying to resolve this one issue and have searched the internet tirelessly for a solution with no luck.    
  
  In my efforts to try pinpoint this problem I started to comment out all the JavaScript scripts and testing the site each time I removed a section of code. I continued to remove sections of code back to the bare minimum and also using Chrome dev tools until I found what was causing the Issue.   
  From what I found is that the dot overlay image with transparency that is overlaid on top of the background image on the landing page is causing this judder, and by removing this the site works fine. 
  
  Although I found what was causing the problem, and because it renders and displays perfect on all the other browsers I still had the issue of trying to find a fix for it on Edge.   
  If I was to leave out the dot overlay image just for the sake of Edge browser the elegant look and feel of the site would be lost with the background image looking to bright and plain and the text looking washed out and hard to read.    
  So I continue to try finding a solution for this problem    
  
  On my search to try find a fix for the issue I came across numerous sites and forums with many offering some sort of solution and lots of comments saying that it was a common Microsoft bug with several posts offering JavaScript hacks and solutions. All of the possible fixes I came across I tried and they did not resolve the issue.
  
  I also tried the Code Institute slack community for some feedback and possible fixes, but all solutions put forward I tried and did not fix the issue.    
  
  My conclusion on this issue is that I decided to leave the Dot Overlay image in the site as it works perfectly fine on the other browsers, with the purpose as I move forward onto the next module JavaScript Fundamentals that I can learn and better understand a way to fix this problem.
  
  
* **Internet Explorer**

  * GitHub and GitHub pages where I have this project deployed does not support Internet Explorer anymore with the message to use Edge, Chrome or Firefox instead.   
  Regardless of this I had a look at the site anyway and there is an issue with the arrow down indicator pushing to the right and off the screen.   
  With further research on the internet I discovered that Internet Explorer is outdated and obsolete browser even with the latest IE11 still being updated by Microsoft but not supporting many of the modern technologies for a modern browser experience and to use Edge instead.

    For these reasons above I cannot conduct proper testing with Internet Explorer on this site as the results would be inconclusive.

#### W3C Validation

* _**Markup Validation Service**_

  This online service was used to check the validation of the HTML code.
  * _**Errors encountered and fixed**_
   
    * **Images:** I removed stray end tags on images that where displaying errors in validation results. The removed end tags fixed the issue.
    
    * **Music Player Embeds:** The music player embeds where displaying errors in the validation  results. The 100% width was giving an error bad value so I removed it and added it to the CSS instead.  
      Removed Frameborder from the music player embeds as it is an obsolete element and I used Border in the CSS instead.   
    I removed Scrolling element from music player embeds.

      Putting the HTML through the validation again displays no Errors or Warnings.
